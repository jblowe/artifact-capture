### Checklists for using the app

These lists will help you capture ceramics data efficiently. The workflow described covers the regular analysis process including filling out the paper Data Sheet and entering data and photos using the app. The workflow is as follows:

* Set up your table with what you will need (pencil, Data Sheets, lights, magnifying glass, diameter charts, tablet, etc.)  Everyone should have their own tablet.  
* Fetch a bag of sherds to work on.  
* Dump them out, arrange them, tag them, measure them, photograph them, enter the data in the paper sheet and the tablet. This is the part of the workflow that is described by the checklists below.  
* Return the sherds to the bag.  
* Tear off the lower part of the T-Tag and place it inside the bag.  
* Tie up the bag as it was, and tie the upper part of the T-Tag to the outside of the bag.  
* Place the original bag in a new plastic ZipLoc bag and seal it.  
* Place the completed bag in the appropriate box.
